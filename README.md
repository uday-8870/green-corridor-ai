# Green Corridor AI

Emergency response delays are often caused by rigid traffic systems, not distance.

Green Corridor AI explores an intelligent traffic management approach that dynamically creates green corridors for emergency vehicles by predicting congestion, optimizing routes, and prioritizing traffic signals in real time.

---

## Motivation

In many cities, emergency vehicles lose critical minutes due to:
- Static traffic signals
- Congestion during peak hours
- Lack of coordination across intersections

This project studies how AI-driven decision systems can reduce response time by adapting traffic flow dynamically rather than relying on fixed rules.

## What This Project Does

- Simulates a city-scale road network
- Models traffic congestion and delays
- Computes optimal routes for emergency vehicles
- Applies signal-priority logic to create green corridors
- Evaluates performance under realistic constraints
